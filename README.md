# dexie Community Translations

[dexie](https://dexie.space) should be accessible for all, and that includes languages. Everyone is invited to improve existing translations or create new ones.

## Participate
To participate, simply clone this repository, make the changes, and create a pull request. Alternatively, you can also edit the file directly on Github, without having to clone the repository first.

Each language has its own directory, containing a single translation.json, which is a JSON File containing all words of dexie. The left side (green text) contains the pointer and should not be changed, the right side (blue text) is the text displayed to the user, this is the translation that can be edited. Be careful to keep the quotes.

Example:
```json
"Connect Wallet": "지갑 연동",
```

## New language
To add a new language, simply create a new directory and name it with the [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) of your language. You can copy the JSON file from an existing language into the new directory as a template.

## Test Translations
Everyone who participates, gets access to the dexie testnet where all translations are automatically updated. 

Translations will usually go live in the next weekly update.

## Questions?
Head over to our [dexie discord](https://discord.gg/3xUrkAxUmd) and join the channel #translators. If you are not familiar with Github, you can also submit translations or suggestions there.
